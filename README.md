dotfiles
========

Linux user configuration files (dotfiles).

For those who change OS or machine very frequently it's very inconvenient to configure everything over and over again. This is my repo to share my own configuration files (although I am not the author of several configuration files themselves nor used modules) throughout my machines. This just creates links from your home folder to dotfiles folder, so all the config files remain there.

Special thanks to Pablo Caro!

Install
-------

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/frankdiox/dotfiles.git
    perl dotfiles/dotfiles.pl

Just clone it and run dotfiles.pl to use these dotfiles, or fork it and modify the configs to have your own thing.
You may need to install some software before (zsh, vim...).
