dotfiles
========

Linux user configuration files (dotfiles).

These are the configuration files I use throughout my machines, although I am not the original author of some of them. This just creates symlinks from the home folder to dotfiles folder, so all the config files remain in the same place.

Special thanks to [Pablo Caro](https://github.com/pcaro90/) for some of the configuration files!

Install
-------

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/frankdiox/dotfiles.git
    perl dotfiles/dotfiles.pl

Just clone it and run dotfiles.pl to use these dotfiles, or fork it and modify the configs to have your own thing.
You may need to install some software before (zsh, vim...).
