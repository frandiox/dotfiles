dotfiles
========

Linux user configuration files (dotfiles).

For those who change SO or machine very frequently it's very inconvenient to configure everything over and over again. This is my repo to share my own configuration files (although I am not the author of several configurations themselves) throughout my machines.

Just clone it and run dotfiles.pl to use this dotfiles, or fork it and modify the congifs to have your own thing.

Special thanks to Pablo Caro!
